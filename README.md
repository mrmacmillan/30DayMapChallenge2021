# #30DayMapChallenge 2021 ðŸŒŽ

The #30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping/cartography/data visualization challenge that happens every November. There are no restriction on tools or data. No need to register anywhere. Just an excuse to make maps and admire maps made by others. Learn more [here](https://30daymapchallenge.com/).

## Day 1 - Points

I saw a CBC News article reporting the Island Waste Management Corporation had a [list of goat farms](https://iwmc.pe.ca/christmas-trees-goat-farms/) that were accepting discarded Christmas trees as feed and I knew immediately that this had to be mapped!

I geocoded the farm and IWMC drop-off center addresses using the provincial civic address database, and created Thiessen/Voronoi polygons which show the closest destination (goat farm or waste watch drop-off center) for all locations on PEI and add some visual interest.

Created with ArcGIS Pro using Esri/John Nelson's Watercolor style.
